### Contractor Skills Object

A Contractor Skills object represents the relationship between a Contractor and a Skill. A Skill is defined by a combination of a [Subject](#subjects) and a [Qualification Level](#qual-level). For example, a Skill might be "Mathematics (A Level)" where "Mathematics" is the Subject and "A Level" is the Qualification Level.

When you retrieve a Contractor Skill, you'll get the full details of the Contractor, along with the associated Subject and Qualification Level information. This allows you to see not just which skills a Contractor has, but also the specific Qualification Levels for each subject they can teach.
