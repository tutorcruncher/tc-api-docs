### Add a Contractor Skill

Creates a new Contractor Skill, representing a relationship between a Contractor and a combination of [Subject](#subjects) and [Qualification Level](#qual-levels). You need to provide the `contractor`, `subject`, and `qual_level` IDs in the request body. Subjects or Qualification Levels custom to another branch, hidden for the branch, or added specifically by the Contractor cannot be used. For more information about what “custom to branch” means, see [Subject](#subjects) and [Qualification Level](#qual-levels).
