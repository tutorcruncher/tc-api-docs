### Create a Service

Creating a Service can be completed simply by giving the `name`, `dft_charge_rate`, and the `dft_contractor_rate`.
This will create a basic Service in TutorCruncher with no Users applied to it. To do this, post a list of user objects
in the `conjobs` and `rcrs` fields. Other fields can be posted to override the branches default settings.
