### Adding a Label to a Service

For more information on Labels, see the [Labels](#label-object) section. Bear in mind that if the Label has been set up to email admins when added to an object, adding a Label through the API will trigger the email.

If you add a Label that has already been added to an object, the Label will not be added again and you will get a normal `200` response.
