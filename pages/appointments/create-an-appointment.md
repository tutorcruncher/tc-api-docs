### Creating an Appointment

Creating an Appointment can be completed by simply supplying the `topic`, `start`, `finish`, `status` and `service`. 
Currently the `status` can only be set to `"planned"`. This will then create a basic Appointment on the service with
no Users applied to it. To add users to the Appointment with or without custom charge and pay rates, see example
on how to pass the data.
