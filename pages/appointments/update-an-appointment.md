### Updating an Appointment

Updating an Appointment is similar to [Creating an Appointment](#create-an-appointment). One major difference is
that you cannot add, edit or delete Recipients or Contractors on the Appointment. To do this you must use the endpoints
[Add/Edit Recipient on Appointment](#create-update-rcra), [Remove Recipient from Appointment](#remove-rcra),
[Add/Edit Contractor on Appointment](#create-update-cja) or [Remove Contractor from Appointment](#remove-cja).
