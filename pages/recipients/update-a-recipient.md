### Update a Recipient

Update a Recipient object by supplying the email address as the unique identifier. You must also supply the required
fields like `last_name` even if they are not being updated. You only need to post information that you want to change
and not the whole Recipient object.

Check out [Creating/Updating Users](#creating-updating-users) for more information on linking to a specific user.
