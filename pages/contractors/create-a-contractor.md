### Create a Contractor

Creating a Contractor can be done by supplying the users information including Contractor specific
information like `status`, `default_rate`, `receive_service_notifications`.

To send a welcome email to the Contractor once they have been created, add `'send_emails': True` in the data like in the 
example.
