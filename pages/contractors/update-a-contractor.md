### Update a Contractor

Update a Contractor object by supplying the email address as the unique identifier. You must also supply required fields 
like `last_name` even if they are not being updated. You only need to post information that you want to change and
not the whole Contractor object.

Check out [Creating/Updating Users](#creating-updating-users) for more information on linking to a specific user.
