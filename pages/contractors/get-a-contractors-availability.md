### Contractor Availability

Return a list of times where the contractor is available and when they have an Appointment in a
continuous stream. You need to pass the contractor's unique `id` in the URL to get their information.

If the contractor availability object is an `appointment` type, that is the times the
contractor has an appointment. If no `available` type objects are visible this means the
contractor has said they are not available for those times, or in some cases, they have not
set up their availability on TutorCruncher.
