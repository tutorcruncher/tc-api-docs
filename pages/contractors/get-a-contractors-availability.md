### Contractor Availability

Return a list of times where the contractor is available and when they have an appointment in a
continuous stream. You need to pass the contractor's unique id in the URL to get their information.

If the contractor availability object is an appointment type, that is the times the
contractor has an appointment. If no available type objects are visible this means the
contractor hasn't said they are not available for those times, or in some cases, they haven't
yet set when they are and are not available to teach.
