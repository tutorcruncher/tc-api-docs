### What are webhooks?

Webhooks are a way for TutorCruncher to push information about events to another app, for example, Zapier or 
your custom-built app.

### When do webhooks fire?

Webhooks are fired from TutorCruncher every time an action takes place involving a user or a job. 
For instance, a webhook would fire when a tutor is created, or a client makes an enquiry.

### What information does a webhook contain?

The webhook contains basic information about the actions such as `action (type)`, `branch`, `verb`, `timestamp`, `actor` 
and `subject`.The `branch` is the id of the associated branch.  The `actor` is the person who performed the action within TutorCruncher. The `subject` is the 
item which the action was performed on. For example, creating/editing a Lesson will send a webhook with the 
details about that Lesson.

and add the webhook URL that you wish your webhooks to be fired to.

### Webhook logs
