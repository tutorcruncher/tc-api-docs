### What are webhooks?

Webhooks are a way for TutorCruncher to push information about events to another app, for example, Zapier.

### When do webhooks fire?

Webhooks are fired from TutorCruncher every time an action takes place involving a user or a job. 
For instance, a webhook would fire when a tutor is created, or a client makes an enquiry.
