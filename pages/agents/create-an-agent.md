### Create an Agent

Creating an Agent can be done by supplying the users information including Agent specific information
like their `commission_rate`.

To send a welcome email to the Agent once they have been created, add `'send_emails': True` in the data like in the 
example.

Check out [Creating/Updating Users](#creating-updating-users) for more information on linking to a specific user.
