### Create a Client

Creating a Client can be done by supplying the users information including Client specific
information like `status`, `associated_admin`, `associated_agent` and branch accounting defaults which can 
be overridden.

To send a welcome email to the Client once they have been created, add `'send_emails': True` in the data like in the 
example.
