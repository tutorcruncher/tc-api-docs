### Update a Client

Update an Client object by supplying the ID as the unique identifier in the url. You must also supply required fields 
like `last_name` even if they are not being updated. You only need to post information that you want to change and
not the whole Client object.

Check out [Creating/Updating Users](#creating-updating-users) for more information on linking to a specific user.
