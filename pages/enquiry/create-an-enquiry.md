### Create an Enquiry, Client and Student

Creating an enquiry can be useful if you want to use a custom enquiry form on your
website. Creating an enquiry also creates a Client and Student like the Socket Enquiry Form, 
where the Client has the Enquiry label attached to them. The returned response is the `id` of
the Client you have just created.
