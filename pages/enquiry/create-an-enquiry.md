### Create an Enquiry

Creating an Enquiry can be useful if you want to use a custom enquiry form on your
website. Creating an Enquiry also creates a Client and Student like the Socket Enquiry Form, 
where the Client has the Enquiry label attached to them. The returned response is the `id` of
the Enquiry you have just created.
